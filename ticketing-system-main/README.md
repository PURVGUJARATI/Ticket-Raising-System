# Ticketing System
An open-source ticketing system to manage projects and tickets alone or in teams. All parts of the system (database, backend with RESTful API and a POC-frontend) are meant to be hosted on your own machine in your local network to be independent of external services.

## Installation
Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/dkettner/ticketing-system/wiki/Home) for installation instructions.

## Disclaimer
- This software is a prototype and likely has a lot of bugs. Use at your own risk.
- Currently it does not encrypt your connections and cannot be considered secure.
- Only host in your local network. Public hosting is highly discouraged.
